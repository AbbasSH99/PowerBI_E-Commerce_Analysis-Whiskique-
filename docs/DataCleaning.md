# ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Transformation â€“ Power BI Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This document outlines the data preparation and transformation process for my Power BI project, including data import, cleaning, relationship management, and metric creation.

---

## 1. ðŸ“¥ Data Import & Setup
- Imported CSV tables:
  - **fact_sales** â†’ renamed to `Sales`
  - **dim_products** â†’ renamed to `Products`
  - **dim_customers** â†’ renamed to `Customers`
- Adjusted relationships:
  - Linked `Products` â†’ `Sales` via **Stock Code** (one-to-many)
- Created initial metrics:
  - `Total Rows` (card visual)
  - `Count of Invoice No` (total invoices)

---

## 2. ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning
### Removing Invalid Transactions
- Filtered out rows where **Invoice No** is `NULL` (per business rule).

### Standardizing Customer State Data
- Imported `state_region_mapping` table.
- Used it to standardize state names via a **many-to-many relationship** with `Customers`.

### Product Name Cleanup
- Replaced `"Indoor Pet Camera (Wi-Fi)"` with `"Indoor Pet Camera"` in `Sales`.

## 3. ðŸ“Š Customer Metrics
- **Number of Customers** â†’ count of unique customers.
- **Customer LTV (avg)** â†’ total sales Ã· total unique customers.

---

## 4. ðŸ“¦ Quantity & Sales Aggregation
- Duplicated `Sales` â†’ created `Invoice Totals` table.
- Grouped by `Invoice No`:
  - Calculated `Total Quantity` and `Total Sales`.

## 5. ðŸ›’ Market Basket Analysis
- Duplicated `Sales` â†’ created `Market Basket` table.
- Established **many-to-many** relationship to analyze product co-purchases.

---

## 6. ðŸšš Shipping Cost Analysis (What-if)
### Baseline Shipping
- Added `Shipping Cost` from `Products` to `Sales` using `RELATED()`.
- Created **Shipping (Baseline)** measure:
  - Quantity = 1 â†’ base cost.
  - Quantity > 1 â†’ base cost + 70% cost for each additional item.

### Dynamic What-if Shipping
- Created **Blended Shipping Cost Factor** table for quantity-based cost multipliers.
- Built **Shipping (What-if)** measure using dynamic cost factor.
- Added **Shipping (Difference)** measure.

---

## 7. ðŸ“ˆ Shipping Metrics
- Created running total measures for:
  - Baseline shipping
  - What-if shipping
  - Shipping difference
- Visualized as area chart.

---

## 8. ðŸ’° Revenue & Profit Calculation
- Added **COGS** column â†’ `Landed Cost Ã— Quantity`.
- Created **Profit (Baseline)** â†’ Sales âˆ’ COGS âˆ’ Shipping (Baseline).
- Calculated **Profit %** â†’ Profit Ã· Sales.
